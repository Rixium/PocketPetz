# PocketPetz
Welcome, Welcome!

You are now a proud of Developer of PocketPetz.
It's gonna be tough getting started, as there's lots to learn, but we've got these docs to help you through.

## Developing the Game

### Getting Started

- Clone this repo locally
- Install [ROBLOX Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create) and get Developer permissions from iRixium
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install the Rojo plugin for Visual Studio Code, from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo)
- Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code
- Start the Rojo server using Ctrl + Shift + P, and searching for 'Start Server' in the pop-up
- Once started, open the Roblox Studio project, and go to Plugins > Rojo > Connect

You should now be able to develop any code using Visual Studio Code, that will be automatically synced over to the Roblox level.

The best way to developer would be to create scripts and assets in a separate level, and bring them over to PocketPetz once you're done. It will help avoid any conflicts with other Developers!

### Working with ROJO

There are some good documentation offered by ROJO, but you can see how it is used by the current project structure.
If you need clarification, don't hesitate to ask the team!

## Administration

As a Developer, you should have access to the top-tier of PocketPetz administration.
You should have been added as an admin by now, but if not, check with the team!
